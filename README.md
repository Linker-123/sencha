## Sencha

A work in progress compiled language written in rust ðŸ¦ž
The parser and tokenizer part of this language are based on the http://craftinginterpreters.com book. The parser is an implemention of the book's Java descent parser. And the tokenizer is the implemention of the book's C scanner.

## Road Map
- Better offset management in the stack
- Support for floating points with xmm registers
- Functions and C calling convention
- Structs and padding for structs
