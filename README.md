## Sencha

A work in progress compiled language written in rust ðŸ¦ž
The parser and tokenizer part of this language are based on the http://craftinginterpreters.com book. The parser is an implemention of the book's Java recursive decent parser. And the tokenizer is the implemention of the book's C scanner.
